**Game Description:**

What is the main action in the game?

The main action in the game is jumping between platforms, trying to reach the end as fast as possible.

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?

Getting the NPC to move around the map randomly and follow the Player when it could see them was definitely the most complex and tricky part to get working. This is mainly because it required communication between a blackboard, behaviour tree, character, controller and two behaviour tree tasks. Also getting the perception working properly took a bit of time.

What is the most interesting part of the game?

Many of the jumps can only be made with good timing and good aiming. So practicing getting the jumps properly and then trying to get them as fast as possible is fairly rewarding and enjoyable.
